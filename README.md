# rowselectionhtmltable

Really old project copied from Google Code. I'm only keeping it for the memories.

Overgrown example of an HTML table that supports row selection on click and highlighting on hover.

Highlight is done with CSS hover action.

Selection is done from the onclick javascript action attribute of the tr (table row) elements.

This example also hides and shows div elements by setting their "class" attribute, which is specified in the css style section.
It used to have google locations hardcoded into it.

The submit button only launches an alert window, or you can download printGetParamsJS.html and rowseltable.html, uncomment the form tag, and put them on your web root if you want to run them locally.
The xml file in the source is a google gadget that is only used to embed the file iframe-style in google code.


EXAMPLE: Enter your address for pizza delivery or pickup:
